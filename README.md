# RAGSystem
### Purpose
Using RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) to revamp the original MIS (Management Information System) offers the following key benefits:
1. Enhanced User Experience
2. Increased Intelligence and Automation
3. Lower Training Costs
4. Improved Efficiency
5. Adaptability to Complex Scenarios
6. Reduced Human Errors
7. Scalability and Integration
8. Dynamic Knowledge Updates
This transformation shifts the MIS system from a traditional manual operation model to an intelligent, automated, and user-friendly platform, significantly boosting operational efficiency and user satisfaction.
### Virtual environment construction & system operation
### Installation dependency
### RAG theory 
1. One of the core secrets of RAG applications is the *conversational mode*, enabling interaction between users and AI through dialogue-based exchanges.

2. RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) leverages external knowledge bases or datasets to assist the generation process, encompassing four stages: *retrieval*, *encoding*, *fusion*, and *generation*.

3. In RAG applications, knowledge retrieved from external knowledge bases must be linguistically assembled and then combined with the user’s question for the AI to respond.

4. The conversational mode can be implemented in code by defining roles for the user, assistant, and system, represented through corresponding messages.

5. The RAG application workflow includes the user asking a question, retrieving relevant knowledge, assembling the language, and passing it to the AI for a response.

6. In RAG applications, memory is achieved by the AI interpreting the user's intent based on prior conversations and correctly answering subsequent questions.

### Return structured data
1. Another core aspect of RAG applications is enabling AI to return structured data, such as Boolean values, integers, floats, arrays, and JSON formats, to meet program requirements.  

2. Large models can help programs interpret and process results by returning data in various formats, such as Boolean values, integers, floats, arrays, or JSON.  

3. By configuring the `content` value of the user role in a conversational mode, you can instruct the model to return data in specific formats, such as Boolean values, integers, floats, arrays, or JSON.  

4. Using a universal method to return JSON-formatted data can help solve problems and provide auxiliary information to understand the model’s output, facilitating debugging and verifying the correctness of the output.  

5. Providing the model with an example to mimic significantly increases the likelihood of it outputting structured data.  

6. In practical applications, even with the above methods, the model may sometimes fail to produce structured data correctly. In such cases, alternative solutions can be explored.  

7. The results returned in a conversational mode are human-readable language, but these outputs need to be converted into structured data that programs can recognize, with JSON being the ideal format.  

8. Sometimes, the AI needs a sample to correctly generate outputs based on the given example.


### UI Implementation and Integration with Free Large Models
### Function Realization
### Improving RAG Applications: Diagnostics, Debugging, and Support for Java and .NET-based MIS Systems
1.  Methods for diagnosing and debugging MIS systems, including `viewing user queries`, enabling an `admin interface`, and adding `administrators`.  

2. By modifying the code and adding an `admin interface`, it is possible to view `conversation logs`, `structured results` returned by the large model, AI-processed outputs, and payloads sent to the model within the MIS system.  

3. Python’s `#region` keyword can be used to group functions of the same type, making the code easier to manage.  

4. To reuse the functionality of the case study in `Java` or `.NET-based` MIS systems, the features can be exposed as API interfaces for these systems to call.  

5. Adding new interfaces, modifying `rag.py` and `views.py`, and registering APIs can enable the functionalities of the case study to be exposed as `external APIs`.  

6. Query results can be converted into strings using a dedicated function, allowing the results to be utilized within the MIS system.  

7. Since AI development is predominantly Python-based, it is not recommended to completely convert existing Java or .NET MIS systems to Python.  

8. Refactoring the code with AI can improve its quality, as demonstrated in the final step.  

9. Explains how to use Python features within MIS systems and reuse the case study’s code for integration.  

10. Adding an `admin interfac`e and `API integration` enables diagnostic debugging and supports Java and .NET functionalities in MIS systems.
