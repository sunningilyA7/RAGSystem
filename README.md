# RAGSystem
### Purpose
Using RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) to revamp the original MIS (Management Information System) offers the following key benefits:
1. Enhanced User Experience
2. Increased Intelligence and Automation
3. Lower Training Costs
4. Improved Efficiency
5. Adaptability to Complex Scenarios
6. Reduced Human Errors
7. Scalability and Integration
8. Dynamic Knowledge Updates
This transformation shifts the MIS system from a traditional manual operation model to an intelligent, automated, and user-friendly platform, significantly boosting operational efficiency and user satisfaction.
### Virtual environment construction & system operation
### Installation dependency
### RAG theory 
1. One of the core secrets of RAG applications is the *conversational mode*, enabling interaction between users and AI through dialogue-based exchanges.

2. RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) leverages external knowledge bases or datasets to assist the generation process, encompassing four stages: *retrieval*, *encoding*, *fusion*, and *generation*.

3. In RAG applications, knowledge retrieved from external knowledge bases must be linguistically assembled and then combined with the userâ€™s question for the AI to respond.

4. The conversational mode can be implemented in code by defining roles for the user, assistant, and system, represented through corresponding messages.

5. The RAG application workflow includes the user asking a question, retrieving relevant knowledge, assembling the language, and passing it to the AI for a response.

6. In RAG applications, memory is achieved by the AI interpreting the user's intent based on prior conversations and correctly answering subsequent questions.
